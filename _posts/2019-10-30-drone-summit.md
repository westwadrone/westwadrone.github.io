We had our kick-off meeting to discuss the use of drones in local public agencies in Western Washington. We met in the City of Edmonds on Sept 20, 2019. This summit was made possible through the collaborative efforts of Greg Lang from Pierce County, Peter Keum from King County and David Rohde from City of Edmonds.
